-- | Inverse and implicit functions via Newton iteration on 'Diff''.
--
-- These are first-order theorems in action: the inverse-function theorem
-- says @(f⁻¹)'(f(a)) = 1/f'(a)@, and the implicit-function theorem says
-- @dy/dx = -(∂F/∂y)⁻¹ · ∂F/∂x@.  We use those derivatives (pulled back by
-- 'Diff'') to drive Newton steps, and verify against exact oracles.
