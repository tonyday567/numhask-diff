-- | Cartesian reverse differential category structure on 'Diff''.
--
-- A /Cartesian reverse differential category/ (Cockett, Cruttwell, Gallagher,
-- Lemay, MacAdam, Plotkin, Pronk, CSL 2020) is a Cartesian left-additive
-- category with a combinator
--
-- > R[f] : A × B → A
--
-- for every morphism @f : A → B@, satisfying seven coherence axioms [RD.1]–
-- [RD.7].  For 'Diff'' the combinator is exactly the bundled pullback:
--
-- > R[f](a, db) = snd (runDiff f a) db
--
-- This module exposes that combinator, the small Cartesian plumbing needed to
-- state the axioms, and value-level checks for all seven axioms.  [RD.6] is
-- homogeneity of @R[f]@ in its cotangent argument; [RD.7] is symmetry of mixed
-- partials (Schwarz), checked via the scalar-line 'Jet' tower.
